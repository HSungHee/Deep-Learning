# TensorFlow
Created by the Google Brain team, TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. TensorFlow bundles together a slew of machine learning and deep learning (a.k.a neural networking) models and algorithms and makes them useful by way of a common metaphor. 

## Tensor
In mathematics, a tensor is an algebraic object that describes a relationship between sets of algebraic objects related to a vector space. Objects that tensors may map between include vectors and scalars, and even other tensors.

# Hypothesis and Cost
$ cost(W, b) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(H(x^{(i)})-y^{(i))})^{2}
